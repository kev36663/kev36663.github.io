I've been a Tester for 11 years.

Like many who have a career in testing, it's something I came into by accident.  I don't regret it, I'm quite good at it.
I've recently been encouraged to start a blog.  There's two-fold purpose to this - the first, I hope to share with you things from my experiences over the past 11 years.  The second, I am currently seeking out new skills and am going to blog my journey - challenges I face and development. 
What I am hoping for is that this can help other testers who wish to learn to develop and also partake in knowledge sharing.

My background is mostly in manual testing.  I don't think you can ever replace a manual aspect of testing, for many reasons, but I want to branch more into Automation.  I don't see this is a simple black and white solution, but, I also don't believe you can ever have too many skills.

My career history includes some time at Northern Rock.  While I don't want to name every company I ever worked for, NR is a very good example of my feeling and position.  It's a bank, it's safe and secure, it's a job for life should I wish.  Ha!  We all know how that ended.  I left on the third round of redundancies.  This set my mindset a bit that you can never be certain of a job for life, plus opened my eyes to wanting to proactively adapt to the future, whilst rediscovering I enjoyed learning new skills.

The question I ask myself is, "If the worst happened - how quickly could I find a new role?" and I think the answer in that is that the better my skillset, the more appealing I am to other companies.  But even as a further question, "Do I *want* to settle down at just one company as a job-for-life?" the answer to that is actually, "Yes", but it has to be the right sort of firm that keeps me interested and that is two-way beneficial.  Plus, as one final question, "Can I learn things that improves my performance at my current company?" and the answer to this one is "Let's explore options."

As mentioned above my background is largely manual testing.  I have a good knowledge on the purposes of automation, the strengths - the weaknesses - but not a hands on working knowledge.  So, this is something I hope to change.

At the time of starting to write - I've already done a little bit of background.  I've completed courses on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) in Ruby, Python and PHP - to get a little background into languages.  I've also completed courses on Git and Command Line.   Next up I'm going to go through the beginners Javascript course as this is one of the main languages in tools such as Selenium and also a range of other frameworks I'm likely to look at.

So, here goes...
