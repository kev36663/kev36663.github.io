title: Codecademy and Me

I mentioned, previously I'd been working through beginners courses on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

I don't want to say these are the be all and end all, there are many great sites like this about, but, I've found the free content very helpful and easy to follow.  The support forum is also a good resource for peers to help each other and that sort of collabortive working is really helpful.  It's also an easier way to discover *why* you are wrong and not just getting the correct answer.

Initially, I'm unconvinced whether I approached from the right angle - but - I think it's a case of what works for you.   I started doing a beginners course on HTML and CSS - mainly to get a look and feel for how Codecademy liked to teach.  These are fairly simple modules, so understanding the approach is very helpful.
From there, I'd worked on assorted languages, Ruby, Python, PHP.  I think my problem was I'd been directionless.  I was working through these courses (and learning) but didn't know where I wanted to go.  
I'd attended a Webinar on Python (hosted by a rep from Selenium and a rep from [Team Treehouse](www.teamtreehouse.com) ) and been a bit, like, "Wow - there's a **huge** demand for Python skills so let's learn all of the Python" - which is all well and good unless you know what you want to do with it.

Not that I regret doing these courses, anything which helps you understand how coding works can be transferred in knowledge so reading through a Dev's code it's easier to work out what the code is doing - but certainly - if you know where you want to be but don't know how to get there, you end up driving in circles until you run out of petrol or get fed up of driving.   Mind, maybe you do discover new roads or pass things you didn't know were there.
I suppose one of the beautiful things about testing is it can be about driving around to see what you can find - but - also, there has to become a point where it's "OK, that's enough seeing the sights - let's go where we want to go"

I won't chalk this down as "starting again", so much - but looking at more direction and keeping progress logged - working out what works and what doesn't and what I need to make the journey.
My plan was... Join Github (hello, I'm here) and then get Selenium running at home and writing some tests on Webdriver and sharing them here.  It's not a terrible plan.  But it needs work.  So having more skills to make it work is only a good thing.

The first thing I discovered was Git is a bit *more* than just a website to store code on.  Ooh.  It's a proper Version Control System.  This may seem a bit dim on my part, but when you've not worked or needed to work in things it's easy to make false assumptions.

A friend of mine passed me the below video to watch, entitled 'Git Happens'

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=yCh6TSLIQBQ" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/yCh6TSLIQBQ/0.jpg" alt="Git Happens" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

It's 37 minutes, but, worth it - a good introduction to Git.  By admission.  A lot I didn't understand at first or didn't quite pin down.  That's fine - I'll cover that in second.  The host, Jessica Kerr, she's extremely passionate about the technology you can tell.   You know, when anyone asks "are you passionate about testing?" - I think she's a definite 'yes'.
But, her passion makes it easier to follow.  This isn't someone giving a presentation because *they have to* this is someone who genuinely loves talking about the subject *and it shows*.

So. My next step was to go over to Codecademy and do their beginners course to Git.  Ohhhh.... it clicks into place now.  Like many Codecademy courses, it's easy to follow.  They don't have to messing around with languages, they're using screenplays as things to amend or update or have conflicting changes and how to handles these - so, it doesn't matter what your programming background is like - you probably know how to use a word processor to add a few lines to a play.
It's the sort of thing which you can do - you just may not know you can do it.

Following that, I did a course on the Command Line.  Getting to grips with this is likely to be pretty helpful in anything.  Turns out there was a lot I knew and even some commands I knew but didn't know they had an alternative use.
Take the CAT command, for example.  I didn't know it could be used to view a file.  I always used it to merge a header file with a record file to create a complete file.  So, even though I knew most of the contents of the course - I still picked up some new bits.
You might know more or less than me before you start - it depends on what you've already been exposed to.

One very important thing to remember - Google is your friend.  If you forget keywords, or how to do something, a quick search can always help you out.  But, knowing the building blocks and what you can do is always a strong head start.

Now I've been through some of the basics, I'm going to look at Javascript next. It's a bit more beefier in terms of content and also it is going back to languages but it's something that will help when I move on to look at frameworks.
